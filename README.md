This GitHub repository hosts the "COVID-19 Data Insights: An SQL Analysis of Global Impact, Vaccination, and Mortality Trends" project, a meticulously curated analysis leveraging SQL to explore and interpret the vast datasets related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Through a series of SQL queries, views, and temporary tables, this project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the pandemic's global footprint, including infection and mortality rates, population impacts, and vaccination progress across different regions. Designed to offer insights into the dynamics of COVID-19, this analysis supports data-driven decision-making for public health strategies and policy formulation. Each script and dataset within this repository is part of an effort to contribute to the broader understanding of COVID-19's global implications, making complex data accessible and interpretable for researchers, policymakers, and the general public.
